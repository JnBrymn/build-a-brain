# build-a-brain
John attempts to build a brain using numpy.


## Versions
* v0.1.0
  * excitatory and inhibitory neurons; linear activation threshold decay
  * the natural firing of neurons died out quickly and each neuron just started firing independently as their activation threshold decreased to 0
  
## Ideas
* Can hebbian learning happen in parallel and in batch?
